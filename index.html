        <div class="details">Meta tags are served to help index pages. The most popular use WAS for keywording but because people abused it now it's really more about content. What is important is author, description, and charset (at least from what I've seen). <strong>Author:</strong> will give the page some authority as well as creating links back to your own page. <br><br><strong>Description:</strong> will pop-up under the link in a Google search. It is advised to start and use "keywords" in your description (reference: wedding wire) Pick up to 5.<code><em>&lt;meta name="description" content="whatever your page is about"&gt;</em></code><strong>charset</strong> is always set to utf-8 unless you are writing in a different language with special characters.<code><em>&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;</em></code><br>Resources:<ul><li><a href="http://htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/metatags/" title="htmlDog - Meta Tags">HtmlDog - Meta Tags</a></li></ul></div>

    	<h2>Forms + Input</h2><div class="cover">Create forms to accept input from your users.</div>
        <div class="details">To start a form:
        <code><em>&lt;form action="processingPhp.php" method="post"&gt;</em></code>
        The action attribute points to the PHP scrip that will deal with the values coming in from the input form. There are two methods, POST and GET. In a form we will use POST. Not sure why.<br><br>
        
        There are all sorts of attritubes for input tags to help organize your form.
        <code> <em>name</em> = an attribute necessary for PHP documents to read value of element.<br><br>
		<em>type</em> = most important attribute in that it tells the browswer what to expect.</code> The following are accepted:<br>

        <strong>Quotes</strong>: There are two types:<br>

        &lt;q <em>cite</em> &gt; the cite attribute is used to cite your source of reference.</code>
        <strong>Code</strong>: is used to show a block of text that is meant to be code. HTML documents automatically set the font to monospace.

    	<h2>Tables</h2><div class="cover">All there is to know about tables!</div>
        <div class="details">
        Tables are easy to create once you understand the tags. Every table needs to begin with a &lt;table&gt; tag. Next we need to decide how many cells our table will have. Say we need 3 rows and 2 columns. HTML tables are written like so: row-column-column-column-row-column-column-column...etc thus for our table our code would look like:
        <code><em>&lt;table&gt;<br>
        	&lt;tr&gt;<br>
            	&nbsp;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br>
                &nbsp;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br>
                &nbsp;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br>
			&lt;/tr&gt;<br>
            &lt;tr&gt;<br>
            	&nbsp;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br>
                &nbsp;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br>
                &nbsp;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br>
            &lt;/tr&gt;<br>
         	&lt;/table&gt;</em></code>
            
        It can be a bit deceiving because by default the table does not have any borders. You'll also want to set border-collapse: collapse so that the borders for each cell line up to it's neighbor. Stupid right? So you probably guess it correctly, <strong>tr</strong> stands for table row and <strong>td</strong> stands for table division (or column in my head). But wait there's more!<br><br>
        
        <strong>colspan and rowspan</strong>: will join a "n" number of columns or rows respectively. These are key if there is no data being presented in neighboring cells.
        <code>&lt;td <em>rowspan="2"</em> &gt; - will join two rows together. Which means you'll have to skip the next one.</code>
        It's best to draw out a table before coding. Remember plan then code and not design while coding.<br><br>
        
        <table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
        	<tr>
            	<th>Header 1</th>
                <th>Header 2</th>
                <th>Header 3</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            	<td>Cell 1</td>
                <td colspan="2">Cell 2 & 3 colSpan</td>
<!---This cell is mia because it is joined with cell to the left -->
            </tr>
            <tr >
            	<td rowspan="2">Cell 4 & 7 rowSpan</td>
                <td>Cell 5</td>
                <td>Cell 6</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            	<!---This cell is mia because it is joined with cell above-->
                <td>Cell 8</td>
                <td>Cell 9</td>                
            </tr>
       </table>
       <br>
       ***NOTE: both rowspan and colspan are attributes of the td tag.<br>
       <strong>&lt;colgroup&gt;</strong> instead of giving each td a special class we can give the entire column a class.
       <code>&lt;colgroup&gt;<br>&nbsp;&lt;col&gt;<br>&nbsp;<em>&lt;col class="special"&gt;</em><br>&lt;/colgroup&gt;</code>
       We can also apply the span attribute to the &lt;col&gt; tags to style 2 or columns similarlly.
       <code>&lt;colgroup&gt;<br>&nbsp;&lt;col&gt;<br>&nbsp;&lt;col <em>span="2"</em> class="special"&gt;<br>&lt;/colgroup&gt;</code>
       The 2nd and 3rd column will be styled by the class special.
      <br><br>
      
      <strong>Table Headers and footers ( &lt;thead&gt; &amp; &lt;tfoot&gt; )</strong>: gives you the ability to set a header and footer row. The footer row can actually go before the rest of the table body.
      <code>&lt;table&gt;<br>
      <em>&nbsp;&lt;thead&gt;</em><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tr&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<em>th</em>&gt;Header 1&lt;<em>/td</em>&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/tr&gt;<br>
      <em>&nbsp;&lt;/thead&gt;</em><br>
      
      <em>&nbsp;&lt;tfoot&gt;</em><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tr&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td&gt;footer 1&lt;/td&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/tr&gt;<br>
      <em>&nbsp;&lt;/tfoot&gt;</em><br>
      
      <em>&lt;tbody&gt;</em><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tr&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td&gt;beginning of table body&lt;/td&gt;</code>
      
      <strong>Note</strong> how although thead, tfoot, tbody are tags we still need the tr tag. We can also have more than one header and footer in a table so long as there is a body to go with it.<br><br>
      <strong>Note</strong> the cells in the table header are different in that instead of a td tag, they use a th tag. The difference? th bolds it's text by default. No such thing exists for the footer.

            </code>
        The main difference between the two is that a section cannot stand on its own. You may nest the elements in different combinations just so long as it makse sense. In our example a section would not be an article because a list of articles would not have been sent as a RSS feed. I.e. it would be weird to have a blog post that covers both the IRS videos and Obama care. If you ever get lost re visit Dr. Bruce's explanation.

    The button tag is different from &lt;input type="button&gt; because we can use images and words to place between tags. Button tags can exists outside of forms. We should always specify the button type because browsers each have a different default. The three types are<ol><li>button</li><li>submit</li><li>reset</li></ol> Seeing that the latter two corespond to a form we should just use button to do something that is not related to a form and use the input tag for form functions.
    
    <code>
    <button type="button" onClick="alert('Ouch!')">Give me your best shot!</button><br><br>

    <h2>Child selectors</h2>
    <div class="cover">Select a specific child in a nested element</div>
    <div class="details">
    <strong>first-child / last-child</strong><br>
    first-child selects the first child of the selected type.
    <code><pre>
    &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;<em>li:first-child</em>&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2nd child - not affected&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;<em>li:last-child</em>&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</pre></code>
    
    Notice we did not say ol:first-child. This instead will look for an element with more than one ordered list and apply the styles to only the first list.
    
	<br><br>
    <strong>nth-child</strong>
    <br>The nth-child relates to the children and not the parent. I.e. if we have a list:<br>
    <code><pre>
    &lt;ol&gt;
   	&lt;li&gt;<em>li:nth-child(1)</em>&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;<em>li:nth-child(2)</em>&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;<em>li:nth-child(3)</em>&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</pre></code>
    Notice that we're not typing ol:nth-child, because ol is the parent. So we're saying search for any li elements that are the nth-child of an element.<br><br>
    <strong>nth-of-type</strong><br>
    Searches any element with a group of element types and adds style to the specific element. I.e.<br>
    p:nth-of-type(2)<br>
    <code><pre>
    &lt;p&gt;1st paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;<em>2nd paragraph</em>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;---adds style to this paragraph
    &lt;p&gt;3rd paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre></code>
    <strong>p</strong>:nth-of-type(2) translates to select the 2nd paragraph in any element and add the following style to it.<br><br>
    <strong>nth-of-type(even/odd)</strong><br>
    Using the same selector we can target only even or odd children in an element.<br>
    p:nth-type(even){ whatever style; }
    <code><pre>
    &lt;p&gt;1st paragraph&lt;/p&gt; &lt;---unaffected since it is an odd number.
    &lt;p&gt;<em>2nd paragraph</em>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;---affected since it is an even number.
    &lt;p&gt;3rd paragraph&lt;/p&gt; &lt;---unaffected since it is an odd number.

    <h2>direct child/sibling selectors</h2>
    <div class="cover">Select only children/siblings</div>
    <div class="details">
   	<strong>&gt;</strong><br><br>
	The difference between ul li{} and ul &gt; li{} is that the latter will only select direct children of ul.
    <code><pre>
    &lt;ul&gt;
    	&lt;li&gt;<em>1</em>&lt;/li&gt; &lt;-----<em>Affected</em>
        &lt;li&gt;<em>2</em>&lt;/li&gt; &lt;-----<em>Affected</em>
        &lt;ol&gt;
        	&lt;li&gt;1a&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;2a&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;<em>3</em>&lt;/li&gt; &lt;-----<em>Affected</em>
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre></code>
    1a and 2a are grandchildren of ul and thus not affected by the style of ul &gt; li{}<br><br>
    
    <strong>Adjacent Sibling Selectors (+)</strong><br>
    An adjacent sibling combinator selector allows you to select an element that is directly after another specific element but it does not affect the 1st element. SO....
    <code><pre>
    p+p{ color: green;}
    
    &lt;p&gt;1st paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;<em>2nd paragraph</em>&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3rd paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre></code>
    
    This is ONLY if the next sibling element is a p element. So under the same stylings
    <code><pre>
    &lt;p&gt;1st paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;2nd paragraph&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3rd paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;<em>4th paragraph</em>&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre></code>
    
    Only the 4th paragraph is affected because the first p element is followed by a div which does not meet the rule of p+p. p+p can translate to any paragraph element that follows a paragraph element has this style.

    <h2>before/after</h2>
    <div class="cover">Add content to elements before and after!</div>
    <div class="details">
    This I can only assume was added to save code/time. We can add images/text before or after elements using after/before psuedo selectors.
    
    <code><pre>
    &lt;p&gt;This is a simple paragraph&lt;p&gt;
    
    Apply some CSS code,
    <em>p:before</em>{
    	<em>content: open-quote;</em>
        color:red;
    }
    <em>p:after</em>{
    	<em>content: '"'</em>
        color:red;
    }
    
    What will display is:
    <span style="color:red;">"</span>This is a simple paragraph<span style="color:red">"</span>
    </pre></code>
    
    Note the use of <strong>content</strong>. These pseudo elements do not create a whole new element, but rather stick content in before the element. The browser actually reads this like &lt;p&gt;"This is...<br><br>
    To stick images instead of text: <strong>content: url("whateverImage.jpg")</strong>

    <h2 style="text-shadow: 4px 4px 6px #999;">Text Shadows</h2>
    <div class="cover">Add depth and make text stand out by creating text shadows!</div>
    <div class="details">Text shadow is supported by most modern browsers. <br><br>Syntax: text-shadow: (offset right) (offset below) (blur amount) (color);<br><br>
    <span style="font-size: 2em;">Sample Text</span> add text-shadow...
    <code>
    <em>text-shadow: 4px 4px 6px #999;</em>
    </code>
    
    <span style="font-size: 2em; text-shadow: 4px 4px 6px #999;">Sample Text</span><br><br>
    
    You want to make sure if a dark text is on a light background the shadow is lighter than the text. Otherwise it distracts more than adds<br>
    
	<span style="font-size: 2em; text-shadow: 4px 4px 6px #000;">Sample Text</span><br><br>
   
	But would the opposite apply?<br><br>
    
    <span style="display: block; margin-top: 15px;padding: 20px; font-size: 2em; background: #00507A; color:#fff; text-shadow: 4px 4px 6px #000;">Sample Text</span>
    <span style="display: block; margin-top: 15px;padding: 20px; font-size: 2em; background: #00507A; color:#fff; text-shadow: 4px 4px 6px #fff;">Sample Text</span><br>
    I guess it's more of a trial and error type of thing. Remember what the guy said, design then code not design while coding ;)<br><br>
    
    If you would like the shadow to fall to the top and left, set your pixels to a negative number. I.e.
    <code>
    text-shadow:<em>-4px -4px</em> 6px #fff;</code>
    <span style="display: block; margin-top: 15px;padding: 20px; font-size: 2em; background: #00507A; color:#fff; text-shadow: -4px -4px 6px #fff;">Sample Text</span>
    <br>
    
    You can also have multiple text shadows to create an emboss effect:
    <code>
    text-shadow:-2px -2px 3px #fff, 4px 4px 6px #000;
    </code>
   
    
    <span style="display: block; margin-top: 15px;padding: 20px; font-size: 2em; background: #00507A; color:#fff; text-shadow: -2px -2px 3px #fff, 4px 4px 6px #000;">Sample Text</span><br>
    Note how much tighter the "highlight" is compared to the "shadow"

<h2>== vs ===</h2>
<div class="cover">The differences between them and why you should only use one over the other.</div>
<div class="details">According to Douglas Crockford we should only use "===" because...<br>
<br>
JavaScript has two sets of equality operators: === and !==, and their evil twins == and !=. The good ones work the way you would expect. If the two operands are of the same type and have the same value, then === produces true and !== produces false. The evil twins do the right thing when the operands are of the same type, but if they are of different types, they attempt to coerce the values. the rules by which they do that are complicated and unmemorable. These are some of the interesting cases:
<pre>
'' == '0'           // false
0 == ''             // true
0 == '0'            // true

false == 'false'    // false
false == '0'        // true

false == undefined  // false
false == null       // false
null == undefined   // true

' \t\r\n ' == 0     // true
</pre><br>

The lack of transitivity is alarming. My advice is to never use the evil twins. Instead, always use === and !==. All of the comparisons just shown produce false with the === operator.

<h2>Strings +</h2>
<div class="cover">Covers a lot about what you can do with strings</div>
<div class="details">String is a type of data object which normally consists of numbers and letters. They do not have any mathematical value, unless we turn "0" to 0. But we cannot turn "zero" into 0.<br><br>

A list of Methods can be found on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp" title="JavaScript String Ojects - w3Schools">w3School's website</a>. So I'll go over the ones I believe will be most useful for us.<br><br>

match() - searches for a match between a regular expression and a string, and returns the matches.<br>
<br>
replace() - Searches for a match between a substring (or regular expression) and a string, and replaces the matched substring with a new substring<br>
<br>
slice() - extracts a part of a string and returns a new string<br>
<br>
split() - splits a string into an array of substrings
<br><br>
<h3>Regular Expression</h3>
Regular expressions are used to perform pattern-matching and "search-and-replace" functions on text.
<br><br>
/i - used to mark an case-INsensitive search.<br><br>
/g - used to mark a global search. Withouth it the search will end once the very first match/search is found.<br><br>

Instead of quotes we use / to enclose a search. I.e. /search/ will search for the word "search".
<code><pre>
var str="Is this all there is?";
var patt1=<em>/is/g;</em> - patt1 = pattern 1
document.write(str.match(patt1)); - return any match with patt1
</pre></code>
What got returned was an array, "is, is" is what got written in the document. Of course we could always write the pattern in the method. I.e. document.write(str.match(/is/g)); We cannot combine variables with strings in one line. We would have to define a new variable or reassign the variable.

<h2>do / while</h2>
<div class="cover">How do while and while loops works</div>
<div class="details">
As long as a value is true the loop will continue. This is useful when you don't know how many times you need to repeat a loop and instead need to wait until something happens.
<code><pre>
<em>while(boolean){
	code
    }</em></pre></code>
The loop will break when the boolean turns false, or when you ask it to by using a break; command. Normally you would put that in an if statement.<br><br>
The do while loop instead will run the code once and THEN check if the condition is true.
<code><pre>
<em>do{
	run this code once.
    }</em>while(boolean)</pre></code>
This allows us to first check a group of code before looping.

<h2>Pop-up Boxes</h2>
<div class="cover">We go over the 3 pop-up boxes Javascript can create!</div>
<div class="details">There are 3 pop-up boxes in Javascript.

<code>
<em>alert()</em> - A pop-up box with the option okay I got the alert<br><br>
<em>confirm()</em> - Will ask user to confirm a question and will return the result as true (okay) or false (cancel)<br><br>
<em>prompt("question", "pre-fill")</em> - Will ask user to type in an answer. Returns a string. Question is what will be asked, and pre-fill is the text that is pre-filled in the box to hint the user.
</code>

If you want to create a new line in the pop-up box us "/n".<br><br>

<button onClick="alert('This is an alert box');" style="padding: 5px;">Alert</button><br>
<button onClick="confirm('Confirm Box');"  style="padding: 5px;">Confirm</button><br>
<button onCLick="prompt('Prompt Box', 'Pre-fill');"  style="padding: 5px;">Prompt</button>

The way we would use prompt is to ask a question and store the answer in a variable for later use. Also true for confirm and if/else conditions. I.e.

<code>
var age = <em>prompt('How old are you?');</em>
if(<em>confirm("Are you over 18?")</em>){ etc...
</code>

Note: We cannot change the answers to confirm. We would have to build a work-around via JS. Default answers are "Okay" and "Cancel".

<div class="details">
So if we were to extract Bat from Batman syntax would look like:

</code>

The syntax is "String".substring(x, y); Where x is the beginning of the cut and y is the end. Notice that we're counting the spaces and not the actual letters. I.e. 0-B-1-A-2-T-3-M-4, thus Whatever is in between 0 and 4 will be pulled.<br><br>

<h2>function</h2>
<div class="cover">How to create a function, etc</div>
<div class="details">Function is a set of code that can be used and resused to execute a bunch of lines.
<code>
<em>function functionName (parameters){<br>
code goes here;<br>}</em> Be sure to place the semi-colon!
</code>

functionName = the custom name of the function. Parameters are values you "pass-through" to the function. I.e. x function will figure out the sum of 4 and 5 and then will pass the sum to function y using the return command. This is more towards the complex stuff. Multiple parameters may be passed by using a comma to separate the different parameters.
There is a different way of creating a function:

<code>
var functionName = function (){}etc.
</code>

This function cannot be called upon until after it's declared. I.e:

<code>
sample();<br><br>
var sample = function(){}
</code>

Will throw an error. The former forces the function to be pushed to the top of the list and gets processed before everything else. Let's stick to the former.<br><br>

NOTE: When declaring a function we do not need to end it with a semi-colon.<br><br>

NOTE: Any variables created within a function is only accessible from within the function. We can edit global variables within a function and also re-create variables within the function without affecting global functions.

<code>
<pre>
var global = 1;

function sample(){
	<em>global = 3;</em> - changes the global variable to 3
    <em>var local = 2;</em> - local is only accessible between the two curly brakets.
    <em>var global = 4;</em> - this overwrites the global variable and creates a local variable. 
    This does not change the global variable.
}
</pre></code>

<strong>Passing in Objects</strong><br>
We can also pass in objects into functions in order to use their properties to do things. We just have to be sure we're passing in objects and not a different data type.

<code><pre>
function ageDifference(person1, person2){
	<em>return person1.age - person2.age;</em>
}
</pre></code>

Of course age or whatever property will have to be defined before calling the function.

<h2> &amp;&amp;, ||, !</h2>
<div class="cover">Logical operators</div>
<div class="details">Sometimes you'll have to see if more than one condition is true before executing a line of code. I.e if x and y are true then do this. Or you might need to check if one of two variables are true to run a line of code.
<code><pre>
<em>&amp;&amp;</em> = and. Both sides of the operator needs to be true for the line of code to run.
<em>||</em> = or if one or both of the sides are true run this line of code.
<em>!</em> = NOT. Turns anything into a negative. I.e. !false = true and !true = false.</pre>
</code>

We would basically use these operators when evaluating two variables or values.
<code><pre>
if(2 < 3 &amp;&amp; 3 > 2){
	this code will run because both equations are true;
} 

if(2 < 3 &amp;&amp 3 > 10){
	This will not run because 3>10 is false;
}

if(2 < 3 || 3 > 10{
	this code WILL run because although 3 > 10= false,
     2 < 3 is true and with || you only need one side to be true.
}</pre>

<h2>Letter case</h2><div class="cover">Learn how and when to change letter casing</div>
<div class="details">The only time it has been explained to me when to change the case of a string is when you are taking a user's answer and using a switch/if statements to create a reaction. So...
<pre>
var ego = prompt("Got money?");
The users input could be "yes" or "Yes" or "no" or "NO" etc.
so to check it with a switch/if statement we would have to use toUpperCase or toLowerCase, otherwise we would have to test for all outcomes.</pre>

<code>
var ego = prompt("Got money?")<em>.toLowerCase();</em>
</code>
This will change all answers to lower case making it easier for us to compare it with a switch etc.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;run code1;
<br>}<em>else</em>{<br>run code2;<br>} - if the boolean is true it will run code1, if it is false it will run code2.

We can write the code without curly braces but it is not recommended because it makes the code less readable.

<h2>isNaN()</h2>
<div class="cover">Checks to see if value is not a number.</div>
<div class="details">Caution when using this function as it's behaviour is somewhat unpredictable. The function returns true if the value is not a number and false if it IS a number.
<code>
<em>isNan("This is not a number")</em> = true;<br>
<em>isNan(0)</em> = false;
</code>


Here are some tricky behaviors of isNan:<br>
<pre>
isNaN(NaN);       // true
isNaN(undefined); // true
isNaN({});        // true

isNaN(true);      // false
isNaN(null);      // false
isNaN(37);        // false

// strings
isNaN("37");      // false: "37" is converted to the number 37 which is not NaN
isNaN("37.37");   // false: "37.37" is converted to the number 37.37 which is not NaN
isNaN("");        // false: the empty string is converted to 0 which is not NaN
isNaN(" ");       // false: a string with spaces is converted to 0 which is not NaN

// This is a false positive and the reason why isNaN is not entirely reliable
isNaN("blabla")   // true: "blabla" is converted to a number. Parsing this as a number fails and returns NaN

<h2>Objects</h2><div class="cover">The building blocks of any Object oriented programming!</div>
<div class="details">Objects are similar to arrays in that they store data. The difference is that instead of storing the data by index number it stores data using custom "keys".
<code><pre>
<em>var newObj = {
	name: "object 1",
    type: "object"
} </em> - NOTICE the brackets are CURLY. This is the short-hand called Object litteral notation.

<em>var newObj2 = new Object();</em> - here we're using the object constructor (new).

newObj2.name = "object 1";
newObj2.type = "object";
</pre></code>

name and type are custom keys to the object. This is how we store and retrieve data from the object. We can also create functions or methods of objects by...
<code><pre>
var newObj = {
	name: "obj1",
	<em>objMethod: function(){}</em>
}

Or

var newObj2 = new Object();
<em>newObj2.obj2Method = function (){};</em>
</pre></code>

We would call the methods...
<code><pre>
newObj.objMethod();
newObj2.obj2Method();
</pre></code>

Notice the commas between keys and the semi-colon outside of the last curly brace. The keys need to be followed directly by a colon. A space between them may cause problems.<br><br>

<strong>The Difference!</strong><br>
One of the differences I have learned is that you cannot use variables to access key names using dot notation, you have to use bracket notation. I.e.
<code><pre>
var james = {
	job: "dad",
    married: false
}

var aKey = "job";

james.aKey; ----this will look for a key named "aKey" which is not what we want.
<em>james[aKey];</em> ---- "aKey" will be replaced by "job" thus JS will look for a key called job which is exactly what we want.
</pre></code>

Another! We cannot create private/public variable/functions using dot notation. We can only do it when we first (being researched) declare the class.
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>typeof</h2>
<div class="cover">Find out the type of a variable</div>
<div class="details">
Say we are taking in input from a user and we want to know what type of data it is. We can use typeof to figure it out.
<code><pre>
var anObj = { job: "I'm an object!" };
var aNumber = 42;
var aString = "I'm a string!";

console.log(<em>typeof anObj</em>); // should print "object"
console.log(<em>typeof aNumber</em>); // should print "number"
console.log(<em>typeof aString</em>); // should print "string"
</pre></code>

typeof pushes out a string. Thus if we ran an if statement it would be
<code>
if(<em>typeof aString === "string"</em>)....
</code>
Note that it's all lower case.

</div>

<h2>hasOwnProperty (objects)</h2>
<div class="cover">Sees if an object has a specific property</div>
<div class="details">
We can check the type of object by checking it it has a specific property.
<code><pre>
var myObj = {
    <em>name: "bob"</em>
};

console.log( myObj.<em>hasOwnProperty('name')</em> ); // should print true
console.log( myObj.<em>hasOwnProperty('nickname')</em> ); // should print false

<h2>for in</h2>
<div class="cover">Looping through objects and arrays.</div>
<div class="details">
Looping through object properties to find specific answers!
<code><pre>
<em>for(var key in obj){
	Run this code please!
}</em></pre>
</code>
A key is a property of an object. It holds information for us. This for loop will cycle through the object keys, no matter their name, and will run the code. The code will run through as many times as the number of properties an object has. I.e. if the object has five properties, the loop will run five times. One for each property.<br><br>
To access the property the loop is on
<code><pre>
for(var key in obj){
	console.log(<em>obj[key]</em>);
}</pre></code>

</div></section>


<section>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<div class="cover">The oh so important methods of objects</div>
<div class="details"> Basically functions stored in objects. To declare one

<code>
<em>obj.meth</em> = function (){ code };
</code>

If the function the created before the object then we can set a function by accessing it's name.
<code><pre>
function setAge(age){
	this.age = age;
}

var susan = {
    age: 25,
    <em>setAge: setAge</em>
};</pre></code>

Notice how setAge has the keyword <strong>this</strong> which makes the function generic until it is assigned to object susan.
</div></section>

<section>
<h2>prototype</h2>
<div class="cover">How to change/add methods in the "classes"</div>
<div class="details">
We can add functions, properties to classes after they have been created by using the prototype keyword.
<code><pre>
function Dog(breed){
	this.breed = breed;
}

<em>Dog.prototype.speak = function(){
	console.log('woof');
}</em>This will add a method to Dog called speak.

</pre></code>

If we do not add the keyword prototype, the method will not get added. It has to reflect back to the original class and not an instance of the class. I.e.
<code><pre>
var Snoopy = new Dog("beagle");
Snoopy.prototype.speak = function(){ code};
</pre></code>
This won't do anything. We can though add functions specifically to Snoopy without affecting any other instances of Dog by taking out prototype.
<code><pre>
Snoop.speak = function(){ console.log("bark");};
Lassie.speak() <em> this will run an error since Lassie doesn't know how to speak unless we add a method to her.</em>
</pre></code>
Why is this useful? My guess is that in case you want something to behave a certain way under certain conditions (ifs) and a different way under different conditions you can add/edit the methods of all classes rather than just one at a time.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong>
We cannot edit a method that is added individually to an instance. I.e. if we assigned shake to Lassie individually and then decide to add the shake method to our Dog class, the code we assigned Lassie will remain unchanged.
<code><pre>
function Dog(breed){
}

var Lassie = new Dog();

Lassie.bark = function(){
  console.log("Hi there!"); <em>This runs</em>
};

Lassie.bark();

Dog.prototype.bark = function(){
  console.log("woof");
};
</pre></code>
My guess is that the prototype is overwritten when we assigned a specific to Lassie. Something like CSS.

<h2>this</h2>
<div class="cover">A generic placeholder for objects.</div>
<div class="details">this acts like a generic placeholder to access various object properties/methods without changing the code.
<code><pre>
function setAge(newAge) {
  this.age = newAge;
};

// now we make bob
var bob = new Object();
bob.age = 30;

// We then assign the generic function to bob, so he can use it. 
<em>this</em> will now turn into bob when bob calls it.

bob.setAge = setAge;
  
// change bob's age to 50 here
bob.setAge(50);
</pre>
</code>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>"class"</h2>
<div class="cover">"class (AS3)" === custom constructors in JavaScript</div>
<div class="details">
Build skeletons of custom objects. Instead of creating an object with the same set of properties/methods, we can build a template and input our own properties into it.

<code><pre>
function Person(name, age){
	this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

var bob = <em>new</em> Person("Bob Smith, 30);
var susan = <em>new</em> Person("Susan Jordan", 25);
</pre></code>

The new keyword turns the function into an object. Similar to var o = <em>new</em> object(); Object is just a built-in template. Be careful of the properties that you pass in. They have to be in the proper order.<br><br>

<h2>Organizing Objects</h2>
<div class="cover">Learn how to keep your objects tidy in arrays.</div>
<div class="details">
Best way to organize, categorize, loop and call upon your custom objects is to keep them in an array. Codecademy suggests that each object is a person's contact info and that the array is like the binding of an address book.
<code><pre>
function person(firstN, lastN, email, telephone){
	this.firstName = firstN;
    this.lastName = lastN;
    this.email = email; <em>Notice that the key has the same name as the parameter. This is okay, but I wouldn't suggest it to avoid confusion.</em>
    this.phoneNumber = telephone;
    addressBook.push(this);
}

var sally = new person("Sally", "Fields", "sfields@baking.com", "9999999");
</pre></code>

Codecademy suggests since we're placing our objects into an array, we don't necessarily need to give our objects names. Instead we would directly place them into the array.

<code><pre>
addressBook[0] = person("Sally", "Fields", "sfields@baking.com", "9999999");
</pre></code>

Honestly I wouldn't recommend doing this because if we do the latter we won't have a direct access to our listing. I.e. we would need to know the index number of sally instead of calling her directly.
<code><pre>
sally.lastName = <em>This won't work because we did not asign a name to our variable.</em>
addressBook[0].lastName = <em>Is the only way to access sally's info. Bummer...</em>
</pre></code>
Codecademy streamlines this process by creating a function to enter all the properties in.
<code><pre>
function add(firstName, lastName, email, telephone){
	addressBook[addressBook.length] = {
    	firstName: firstName,
        lastName: lastName,
        email: email,
        phoneNumber: telephone
    }
}
</pre></code>

<strong> Notes</strong><br>
addressBook.length will always be 1 more than the index number the array is on since arrays are zero index. Thus using this will always add the new contact to the end of the array. Not sure why we couldn't use the push method of the array? Notice the names of the keys are the same as the parameters, which is fine, just don't get it confused or use different names.
</div></section>

<h2>clone..sorta</h2>
<div class="cover">No clone, so here's the next best thing.</div>
<div class="details">
There is no direct clone method in javascript. Parameters do not pass to the "clone". But we can copy any set property/methods (even ones modified by prototype) to a new class to mess around with.
<code><pre>
function Bird(name){
    this.name = name;
    this.laysEgg = true; 
}

function Penguin(name){
    <em>this.name = name; // We have to add this because Bird takes this parameter</em>
 }

<em>Penguin.prototype = new Bird();</em>

var Penny = new Penguin("Penny");

for(var i in Penny){
    console.log(i + ": " + Penny[i]);
}

Output:
"name: Penny"
<em>"laysEgg: true"</em>
</pre></code>
I hear mootools(framework) has a solution to it. Not sure if it works. Here is the discussion on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/122102/most-efficient-way-to-clone-an-object" title="Most efficient way to clone an object - JavaScript || Stackoverflow.com">Stacks</a>. Look a couple answers down, the most-voted is for a jQuery solution, which I'm not sure works.

</section>

<section>
<h2>Private &amp; Public</h2>
<div class="cover">Find out how to make variables/methods private</div>
<div class="details">
We can assign variables/methods that are only accessible via class.
<code><pre>
function Person(name){
	this.name = name;
    <em>var bankBalance = 5929;</em> - variable
    <em>var doSomething = function(){
	    //private code
    }</em> - private method/function
}
</pre></code>

this.name = name is public because it assigns itself to the new instance. Variables only exists within functions and making a function/method a variable it will not be accessible outside of the class. To access private method/variables you need to have a public method to "return" the values.

<code><pre>
this.askTeller = function(){
	return bankBalance; // returns variable.
    return doSomething; // be careful NOT to call the function by adding ()
}
</pre></code>

Codeacademy suggests passing in a parameter to add some measure of secruity.
<code><pre>
this.askTeller = function(pass) {
     if (pass == 1234){
     return bankBalance; 
     }//note how equals is == and not === because we could have passed a string instead of a number.
     else{
      return "Wrong password.";
     };
   };
</pre></code>

<strong>*** Being Researched ***</strong>
It seems like we can only declare private methods/variables when we first declare the class. I.e. we can't easily modify it simply by using obj.prototype like how we can with public methods/variables.

    <div class="details">In order for jQuery to work in a web page we first must load it.
    <code>&lt;script src="../js/jquery-1.10.0.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
    <a href="http://jquery.com/download/" target="_blank">Download a copy of the latest jQuery here!</a> Do more, write less!<br><br>
    Once you loaded the jQuery to your webpage, you must start every jQuery code with:
    <code><em>$(document).ready(function(){YOUR CODE GOES HERE});</em></code>
    What this does is wait for the document to load before loading jQuery. If we don't have this jQuery will load at the same time as the html file. Sometimes the jQuery file will load faster and will have issues finding elements which have yet to be loaded, making the code to break. As of right now we can place variables and custom functions outside of the ready event.<br><br>
    <strong> UPDATE!</strong><br>
    So apparently there is another way to execute jQuery just in case we use a different framework that also uses the dollar sign.
    <code><em>jQuery(function($){ ALL YOUR CODE GOES HERE });</em></code>
    This will do two things, one it will load only once the DOM is loaded and will ensure that everything in between the brakets is jQuery and not a different framework. All of your code will go in between the brakets include variables and custom functions.

    We can pull what's inside the li tag when we use .html() i.e.

        There is another way to code these lines which some folks think is more readable
        <code><ul>
        <li><em>.appendTo(&lt;element&gt;)</em></li>
        <li><em>.prependTo(&lt;element&gt:) </em></li>
        <li><em>.insertAfter(&lt;element&gt:) </em></li>
        <li><em>.insertBefore(&lt;element&gt:) </em></li>
        </ul>
        <br>The syntax would be: <em>var.appendTo($('element tag'));</em></code>
                
        <strong>How to remove nodes from DOM</strong>
        
        <code><em>$('button').remove();</em> - will remove any element with a button class from the DOM.
        </code>
		Note the HTML code is a string. So we can place a variable or a string or a combo of both. I.e. "&lt;span&gt;This tag " + thisVar + "&lt;span&gt;"<br><br>
        Also note, just like in a HTML doc, we have to close the tags!    
    </div>
    </section>
    
    <section>
    	<h2>Prevent Default</h2><div class="cover">In order to prevent default HTML actions use this!</div><div class="details">So for example if we want to make something happen via jQuery and we're using an a tag to make it happen we don't want the default action to occur. I.e.
        <code>&lt;a href="#mouseAction"&gt; - the browswer will by default move to the tag with the mouseAction id</code>
        This isn't what we want. So instead we must place this into our function that is excuted with the target tag is clicked.
        <code>function mouseAction(e){<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>e.preventDefault();</em><br>
        });<br>
        <br>
        $("#flights a").bind("click", mouseAction);</code>
        "e" is the event that is passed through into the function, in this case it would a mouse click. The preventDefault(); function will stop the browser from moving to the tag with mouseAction id tag.
        </div>
     </section>
    
    <section>
    	<h2>bind();</h2><div class="cover">Add multiple event listeners to a specific element at once.</div>
        <div class="details">Instead of writing a whole bunch of lines to add multiple listeners to a button we can combine everything into a few lines.
        <code>$("#button").click(buttonClick);<br>
        $("#button").mouseenter(mouseEnter);<br>
        $("#button").mouseleave(mouseLeave);<br><br>
        
        We can conver this to:<br>
        $("#button")<em>.bind({<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;click: buttonClick,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouseenter: mouseEnter,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouseleave: mouseLeave<br>
        });</em>
        </code>
        
        To unbind or disable the listeners, simply use:
        <code>$("#button")<em>.unbind(click, buttonClick);</em> - this will disable click.</code>
        
        An easier way of unbinding all the events would be to <strong>NameSpace</strong> all of the events.<code>click<em>.nameSpaceName</em></code>
        So instead of identifing click or mouseenter we can put
        <code>.unbind(<em>".nameSpaceName"</em>);</code>
        </div>
        </section>
        
        <section>
        <h2>delegate();</h2><div class="cover">Similar to bind, but instead it constantly looks for a tagin a certain element</div><div class="details">So bind will only look for the tag once jQuery is loaded. When you're using dynamic pages things will refresh constantly without reloading the page/DOM. Thus bind will not work with dynamic information. Instead use the delegate() function to constantly be on a look out for the tag to attach actions to.
        <code>$("#tabs div")<em>.delegate("#flights a", "click", selectFlight);</em></code>
       	This will constantly look for the correct tag only in the specified element. In this case only in the #tabs div elements.<br><br><br>
		There is another route which is the live() function. The major issue with this fucntion is that it will look through the entire document rather than just a few elements. This takes up more resources than necessary. Also live cannot be method chained.</div>

	<h2>puts/prints</h2><div class="cover">Learn the difference between the two.</div>
    <div class="details">
    Both "print" something on screen but the difference is that puts has a breakline after whatever you place.
    <code><pre>
    <em>print "howdy "
    puts "ho"
    print "Aloha "
    print "kakou"</em>
    
    Outcome:
    howdy ho
    Aloha kakou</pre></code>
    Note that there are no parenthesis or semicolons. If we add /n to print, it will print a new line. Hence print + /n = puts<br><br>
    A shortcut to puts is using <strong>p</strong>. <strong>p</strong> will also return a more programmer friendly result.
    <code><pre>
    array = [1, 2, 3]
    
    puts array #=&gt;
    	1
        2

	<h2>string methods</h2><div class="cover">Learn things you can do with strings =)</div>
    <div class="details">
    <strong>length</strong><br>
    Finds the length of a given string.
    <code><pre>
    "Bob"<em>.length</em>
    
    Output: 3</pre></code>
    
    <strong>reverse</strong><br><br>
	reverses the string. No way!
    <code><pre>
    "Sally".reverse
    
    Output: yllaS
    </pre></code>
    
    <strong>upcase/downcase/capitalize</strong><br>
    Sets the casing for a certain string.
    <code><pre>
    "sally"<em>.upcase!</em>
    "Bobby"<em>.downcase!</em>
    "danger"<em>.capitalize!</em>
    
    Output: SALLY bobby Danger
    </pre></code>
    
    <strong> ! Note</strong> When applying string methods in Ruby, it will copy the string apply the method and return the copy. Thus the new version is never really saved in the variable. Thus in order to do that we add an <strong>!</strong> which will erase the original and save the changed version.<br><br>
    <strong>Work Around</strong><br>
    I came across a problem via codecademy.com. We asked the user which state she was from. If she types in the abbreviation already capitalized Ruby would return a nil value. If there is no changes made when a upcase! or downcase! is called the method will return a nil (similar to null).
    <code><pre>
    state = gets.chomp.upcase!
    
    USER = HI
    
    print state
    
    OUTPUT = nil</pre></code>
    
    So instead we can break this up into 2 lines.
    <code><pre>
    state = gets.chomp
    <em>state.upcase!</em> This line will only replace the original value only if the copy is not a nil. If it is a nil then the original will not be distrub. Since upcase! ONLY returns a nil when the string is already upcased this will act as our checker.
    </pre></code>

    gets automatically creates a newline after each input. <strong>chomp</strong> gets rid of that new line. Our program will work just fine without chomp but we'll have extra blank lines everywhere. So...
    
    <code><pre>
    Say our input was Sally

        puts "maybe?"
    <em>else</em>
        puts "it is false!"
    <em>end</em>
    </pre></code>
        Notice there are no parenthesis or curly braces. <strong>else if</strong> is typed <strong>elsif</strong> Only the FIRST e in else. Also note to end the if statement we have to place in the word end. Ruby <strong>ignores</strong> white spaces, but it's convention to place 2 space to indent things. I'll use tab until told otherwise.
        <br>
        <strong>Short hand version</strong>
        <code>
        run this code <em>if boolean</em>
        </code>
        run this code will run only if the boolean is true<br><br>
        <strong>Ternary conditional expression</strong><br>
		Basically one line: if/else statement
        <code>
        puts 3 < 5 <em>? "true" : "false"</em>
        </code>
        This line can be read: "if 3 is less than five run true, else run false" The order of the expressions is important.<br>
        puts [condition] ? if true run this : if false run this

<section>
	<h2>unless</h2><div class="cover">The opposite of if</div>
    <div class="details">
    Unless is pretty much the opposite of if.
    <code><pre>

    <em>unless hungry</em>
    	puts "I'm writing Ruby programs!"
	else
    	puts "Time to eat!"
	</pre></code>
    
    Code after unless will only run if the statement is FALSE. If it is true it will run else. Unless does not have the option to chain. I.e. elsif does not work.<br><br>
    Just like if, shorthand version works as well.
    <code>
    run this code <em>unless boolean</em> #=&gt; code will run if boolean is false.

	<h2>while / until</h2><div class="cover">while and until loops!</div>

    <strong>while</strong>
    Much like the other while loops.

    boo = true
    
    while boo
    	run this code
        boo = false
    end

   	The while loop will run until the boolean turns false.<br><br>
    <strong>until</strong><br>
    Complete opposite of while. Until will run the code so long as the boolean is false.
    <code><pre>
    boo = false
    
    until boo
    	run this code
        boo = true

    This code counts from 1-9<br>
    ... means exclude the last number, in our case, 10<br><br>
    .. means include the last number. Our output would have included 10.<br><br>

	<h2>Range</h2><div class="cover">Iterate between values</div>
    <div class="details">
    Set a range to count values. Either alphabetical or numbers.
    <code><pre>
    <em>(1..5)</em> #=&gt; counts from 1-5
    <em>(1...5)</em> #=&gt; counts from 1-4 ... excludes the last number.
    <em>("a".."z")</em> #=&gt; alphabet from a-z
    
    <em>array = (1..5).to_a</em> #=&gt; creates a variable array[1, 2, 3, etc..]
    puts <em>array[0..-1]</em> #=&gt; Will put out every single value of the array.    
    </pre></code>
    
    What (0..-1) mean I have not clue. My guess 0-infinity? But this only works when used in arrays or strings. Normally ranges have to begin with low to high. (0..any other negative number) does not work.
    </div>

<section>
	<h2>Upto / Downto</h2><div class="cover">Much like range counting up/down</div>
    <div class="details">
    	Upto counts from a low number up to a high number. The opposite is true for downto.
        <code><pre>
        <em>2.upto(5) { |i| puts i }</em> #=&gt; counts from 2-5
        
        <em>"Z".downto("A") { |i| puts i }</em> #=&gt; lists Z - A

<section>
	<h2>loop (Ruby)</h2><div class="cover">Loop Ruby style!</div>
    <div class="details">
    Another way to loop blocks of code is by using the method loop.
    <code><pre>
    i = 1
    <em>loop</em> do
    	i += 1
        puts "#{i}"
        break if i <= 10
	end
    </pre></code>
    
    A couple of things:<br>
    <strong>do/end vs { }</strong> these are interchangable. Thus we can write loop { block of code } instead of loop do block of code end<br><br>
    <strong>break if i &lt;= 10</strong> is a single line command. Notice how we do not need end at the end of if. This is how to stop the loop. As soon as the condition is met the loop ends.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>next (in loop)</h2><div class="cover">Skips a step in the loop</div>

        print "#{i}"
        break if i <= 10
    }
    </pre></code>
	If the next condition is met, the loop breaks and tries again. NOTE if the increment is after the next command, the loop will become infinite since no changes are being made.

	<h2>arrays</h2><div class="cover">Ruby arrays and how to loop through them</div>

    <code><pre>
    array<em>.each do |X|</em>
    	x += 10 #increases each number by 10
    end
    </pre></code>
    
    Each is actually a method of the object class, thus it can be applied to objects as well as arrays. We can use &amp; and | to join or remove elements in the array.
    
    <code><pre>
a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
b = [5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2]
a <em>|</em> b #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # duplicates are removed
b <em>|</em> a #=> [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] # duplicates are removed but order is backward.
a <em>&amp;</em> b #=> [2, 3, 4] # elements that are in both arrays are kept.
b <em>&amp;</em> a #=> [4, 3, 2]
    </pre></code>
    
    The statements can be read, elements in a or(|) elements in b. And, elements in a and(&amp;) elements in b. <strong>NOTE</strong> There is no real guarrentee that the order will be precise.

    my_has["key1"] = value1

    <div class="details">
    Loop over hashes by creating 2 variables, one for the key the other for the value.
    <code>
    hash.each { |key, value| puts "#{key}: #{value}" }
    </code>
    Which results in key: value.<br>
    To loop over array values it's the same except we only have to create a variable for the value.
    <code>
    array.each { |value| puts value }
    </code>
    This will output every value of the array.

    method<em>?</em> = this method returns a boolean.
    </pre></code>
    <strong>!</strong>, the only thing I learned thus far is if we execute any method, the method returns a copy and does not change the original value of the variable. If we add ! to the end of the method then the value of the variable is changed to the result of the method.

    <h2>method return</h2><div class="cover">Return something from a method</div>
        <div class="details">
        Sometimes we want a method to return an answer to a question or something along those lines.
        <code><pre>
        def cube(n)
            <em>return</em> n ** 3
        end
        </pre></code>
        
        ** = Exponential<br>
        If we are using puts to relay the return use it just like a variable.
        <code><pre>
        def sample(word)
            return word
        end
        
        puts "like this? <em>#{sample("Nice!")}</em>"
        
        output: like this? Nice!
        </pre></code>
        
        If there is no return value Ruby will default and return the last expression in the method. Thus even if we didn't have <em>return</em> word it will still have returned word.
        
        <code><pre>
        def sample(word)
        	<em>word</em>
        end

	<h2>symbols</h2><div class="cover">Objects with names?</div>
    <div class="details">
    	Honestly haven't really wrapped my head around this one. Here are some resources in case this doesn't make any sense.
        <ol>
        	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBXGBbEbXZY">24 min YouTube video, very helpful</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.robertsosinski.com/2009/01/11/the-difference-between-ruby-symbols-and-strings/">A blog post showing how symbols save memory space. Can't understand the rest.</a></li>

        </ol><br>
        Let's go into syntax:
        
        <code><pre>
        <em>:symbol
        :"symbol"</em>
        
        In hash:
        hash = {
            <em>key: value1
            :key2 =&gt; value 2</em>
        }
        
        Conversions:
        "symbol"<em>.to_sym</em> OR "symbol"<em>.intern</em> = String to Symbol
        :symbol<em>.to_s</em> = Symbol to String
  		</pre></code>
        
      	Symbols are similar to variables. In fact variables are symbols. Once a symbol is created it's name cannot be changed, though it's value can. IE hash[:key] = "some other value" is valid. But unlike strings we cannot add or take away from it.
        
        <code><pre>
        string = "hello"
        string &gt;&gt; ", world" #=&gt; will change string to = "hello, world"
        
        string2 = :hello
        string2 &gt;&gt: ", world" #=&gt; will result in error
        </pre></code>
            
        In the 2nd case we're assigning an object (string2) to another object (:hello) thus we can't attach a string to it.

<section>
	<h2>delete key</h2><div class="cover">Delete a key from a hash</div>
    <div class="details">
    	Delete a key and it's value from a hash.
        <code><pre>
        hash = {
        	first: 1
            second: 2
        }
        
        hash<em>.delete(:first)</em> #=&gt; will result in deleting the key first.
        </pre></code>
        
        Note that if the keys were represented by a string it would have been delete("first") instead.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>respond_to?</h2><div class="cover">Checks to see if an object has a method in it</div>
    <div class="details">
    	My guess this is more for troubleshooting than anything else.
        <code><pre>
        myAge = 24
        
        myAge<em>.respond_to?(:next)</em> #=&gt; results in true
        </pre></code>
        
        next is a method which returns the next integer. In our case, 25. Notice how (:next) is a symbol.

    	<code><pre>
        Instead of using
        prime_array = [] if prime_array.nil?
        
        use
        prime_array <em>||=</em> []
        </pre></code>
        prime_array will only be assigned to [] if it is nil to begin with. If there is something in the array, nothing will be done.

<section>
	<h2>collect / map</h2><div class="cover">Executes a code on each element in the array.</div>
    <div class="details">
    	Executes a piece of code on each element. It seems it's mostly only for numbers.
        <code><pre>
        nums = [1, 2, 3]
        
        nums<em>.collect</em> = { |x| x ** 2 } #=&gt; 1, 4, 9
        </pre></code>
        
        This won't overwrite nums. Instead it will only return the result. To overwrites nums, we would use collect! <strong>map</strong> does the exact same thing.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>block</h2><div class='cover'>Block is a bunch of code between {}</div>
    <div class="details">
    A block is just a bit of code between do..end or {}. It's not an object on its own, but it can be passed to methods like .each or .select.
    
    <code><pre>
    array = [1, 2, 3]
    
    array.each <em>{|x| x * 2} #=&gt; multiplies each element by 2.</em>

</section>

<section>
    <h2>yield</h2><div class="cover">Pass blocks into methods/functions</div>
    <div class="details">
    	Okay let's be clear that yield is still kind of fuzzy. Mostly because I have no clue why/how you would use it. Basically you can pass blocks into methods/functions just like a parameter.
        <code><pre>
        def double(param)
            <em>yield param</em>
        end
        
        <em>double(4) {|x| x * 2 }</em>
        </pre></code>
               
    </div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>proc / lambdas</h2><div class="cover">Save a "block" with different Restrictions</div>
    <div class="details">
    	<strong>Proc</strong><br>
    	Save a block {} so we can re-use it again and again.
        <code><pre>
        <em>cube = Proc.new { |x| x ** 3 }</em>
        
        [1, 2, 3].collect!(<em>&amp;</em>cube) # ==> [1, 8, 27]
        [4, 5, 6].map!(<em>&amp;</em>cube) # ==> [64, 125, 216]
        </pre></code>
        
        Similar to a function/method. We have to use the &amp; before the name to indicate that it is a block. It also has to be used only when expecting a block. <strong>Note</strong> when you call the proc, we use () instead of curly braces. It doesn't even have to be a block it can be a simple puts command. We use the <strong>.call</strong> command to call it.
        <code><pre>
        sample = Proc.new {puts "Hello"}
        
        sample<em>.call</em> #=&gt; Hello
    	</pre></code>
        
        So does this replace method/functions?<br><br>
        <strong>Simplify blocks in procs</strong><br>
        We can use &amp; instead of |x| to do things to each element in an array etc.
        <code><pre>
        numbers_array =  [1, 2, 3]
        
        strings_array1 = numbers_array {|x| x.to_s} #=&gt; "1", "2", "3"
        
        strings_array2 = numbers_array(<em>&amp;:</em>to_s) #=&gt; "1", "2", "3"
        </pre></code>
        
        &amp; = |x| and x or do this to each element in the array. <strong>Note</strong> when using the &amp; we use parenthesis () rather than curly braces like how we use in blocks. Also is_a? does not work. Not sure why. Maybe only conversions work with &amp;:? Even in Lambdas, we must use parenthesis instead of curly braces. <br><br>
        
        <strong>Lambda</strong><br>
        Same as a Proc with some exceptions:
        <ol><li>A lambda checks the number of arguments passed to it, while a proc does not. This means that a lambda will throw an error if you pass it the wrong number of arguments, whereas a proc will ignore unexpected arguments and assign nil to any that are missing.</li>
        <li>Second, when a lambda returns, it passes control back to the calling method; when a proc returns, it does so immediately, without going back to the calling method.</li></ol>

    over_4_feet = Proc.new { |height| height >= 4 }
    
    can_ride_1 = group_1.<em>select</em>( &amp;over_4_feet ) =#&gt; 4.1, 5.5, 6.1, 4.7

    </pre></code>
    <strong>initialize</strong> basically runs once the class becomes created. Attributes are properties passed into the class. For instance if we had a class named bird, lays egg would set to true, etc.

    <strong>attr_accessor</strong> allows us to access variables in instances. attr_writer/attr_reader is write/read respectively. We can overwrite methods by simply rewriting them and we can call the original method by using the <strong>super</strong> keyword.
    
    <code><pre>
    class Human
    	def fight
        	puts "throws punch"
        end
    end
    
    class Warrior &lt; Human

    Stark = Warrior.new
    Stark.fight
    
    Output:
    Swings sword
    throws punch

    If we do not add super, warrior's method fight will replace human's fight.

	<h2>attr_accessor</h2><div class="cover">How to access variables in a class.</div>
    <div class="details">
    We cannot access variables in a class unless we define it as an attribute or create a function that allows us to access it. So of Ruby had to make it easier/shorter.
    <code><pre>
<em>attr_writer :age</em> # is the same as...

def age=(value)
  @age = value <em>How we would assign the age variable is instance_name.age = 27</em> 
  # NOTE we cannot read this variable, only assign it.
end

<em>att_reader :age</em> # is the same as...

def age
  @age <em>instance_name.age = 27</em> NOTE we cannot overwrite this variable and can only read it.
end

<em>attr_accessor :age</em> # is the same as both of the above methods combined. We can assign and read age using this.
    </pre></code>
    
    We can access age with dot notation. Without attr_reader/attr_accessor we would have to write a method to access the variables.<br>
    <strong>attr_reader</strong> = read only<br>
    <strong>attr_writer</strong> = write only<br>
    <strong>attr_accessor</strong> = both<br>
    This is how we can assign a password. I.e. one method takes in the password (<strong>attr_writer</strong>), assigns it to a <strong>att_reader</strong> thus we cannot access the information from outside of the class.

        The difference between require and inclue is that with require the methods of the module stay within the module. I.e. to access any methods within a required module we must say module_name.method. With include we won't have to type the module name but then we come across a problem in that our function names may collide.

    next_room = room.call()
  end
end
    </pre>
    </code>
    What this does is places the function "bridge" in the variable be room. Then calls, initiates, or uses the function by using the call method (room.call()) The method/function ("bridge") then RETURNS the next function in the program that needs to be run via if statements, etc. The next function name is returned as a symbol (or string if you code sloppy), say :sick_bay. next_room is then reassigned to :sick_bay (from :bridge). The loop recycles and assigns room to :sick_bay, the next function in the program. Because while is an infinite loop, the program will run until it executes an exit.

    <h2>Setup Rails Table</h2><div class="cover">Steps to setup an Active Record Table.</div>
    <div class="details">
        You could always use rails scaffold command to set everything up for you. But we had to learn it the hard way, thus I'm taking notes on the hard way.
        <code>rails generate model 'name'</code>
        Creates a migration file to setup the table. If we had passed in parameters the migration would have written the code necessary to create columns in our table.
        <code>rails generate model <em>title:string author:string post:text</em></code>
        Would have put in code in the migration file to create 3 columns. Otherwise can go into the migration file and edit it before we run the rake command. Once you're happy with the migration file.
        <code>rake db:migrate</code>
        Rails reads all of your new migration files and runs them to create a table. If we wanted to add another column to the table we would have to create another migration file so that when someone downloads this project they too will have to exact same table we are working with. So now we can go to the Rails console and access our table using the class name, in our case Blog.<br><br>
        We can do things the hard way and populate the table using the create method # Blog.create(title: "Dinosaurs", author: "Mickey"). Or we could create code things in the seed file and then run it.
        <code>rake db:seed</code>
        Rails will run the seed file as if you were in the console. Rails runs the file every time you enter rake db:seed, regardless if you have ran it previously. I.e if Blog.create(title: "Dinosaurs", author: "Mickey") is in the seed file, and we enter rake db:seed twice we would have two objects with title "Dinosaur" and author "Mickey"
