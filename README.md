FancyNotes
==========

My Attempts to keep track of code notes via raw html / css and little bit of js.

### About

This static site was meant to help me keep track of syntax great tips as I learned how to write code. 
Everything was hard coded in. I am astonished by how many useless lines I wrote. Obviously this project was abandoned
once I figured out what a real web app looks like. I'm keeping this around for nostalgic purposes. =)
